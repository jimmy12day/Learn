DICTIONARY is preferred than HashTable because it is typesafe; Both are good for quick finding and remove
LIST is preferred than ARRAYLIST
HASHSET is useful for creating unique sets of lists and quick to locate
ARRAY is fast, but array is fixed size, good example is allow shooting 50 bullets each load for a gun,array is fast
